Shortly before the production of RP6 CD-ROM, the new Version 20070525 of
WinAVR became available. Usually you should not 
have any problems with this release, but if you do have problems and you 
are using Win2k or XP you can also try to install Version 20070122 
or even the older 20060421.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
IF YOU ARE USING WINDOWS VISTA, YOU HAVE TO USE THE NEWEST RELEASE!

ATTENTION: VISTA 64 Bit is NOT supported directly at this time! 
But there is a Patch available, made by Thomas Bleeker 
(http://www.madwizard.org/ ). 
You can find the Patch in the Win_x64_PATCH folder!

You can install WinAVR on Vista as follows: 
- Run the WinAVR 20070525 Installer!
- Replace the DLL WinAVR/utils/bin/msys-1.0.dll with the one you find 
in the zip archive on the CD!

That's it.

-----------------------------

If you are using old Win98SE or WinME systems, you can use the old 
20060421 Version or you can try to patch the newer Versions!
It will most likely NOT work directly with the newer Versions on old Win98!
